## Introduction

This package provides fit-for-purpose functions for calculating and presenting the results from the Model Disability Survey, as used by the World Health Organization.

## Model Disability Survey

The Model Disability Survey (MDS) is a World Health Organization (WHO) general population survey instrument to assess the distribution of disability within a country or region, grounded in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. For more information, please go to http://www.who.int/disabilities/data/mds/en/

## How to use

An extensive guide on using the package is available. Please email me at leel@who.int for access. In the future, this will be included as a vignette.

## Warning

The package is still very much in development mode, so there is much work that needs to be done. If you notice any bugs or have any suggestions, please email me at leel@who.int, or submit an issue.


## Who am I

I am a technical officer in the Disability Programme at the WHO and responsible for work related to the MDS. Please email me at leel@who.int if you have questions or comments.
