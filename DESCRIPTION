Description: The Model Disability Survey (MDS) <https://www.who.int/disabilities/data/en/> is a World Health Organization (WHO) general population survey
    instrument to assess the distribution of disability within a country or 
    region, grounded in the International Classification of Functioning, 
    Disability and Health <https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/international-classification-of-functioning-disability-and-health>. This package provides fit-for-purpose functions 
    for calculating and presenting the results from this survey, as used by 
    the WHO. The package primarily provides functions for implementing
    Rasch Analysis (see Andrich (2011) <doi:10.1586/erp.11.59>) to
    calculate a metric scale for disability.
